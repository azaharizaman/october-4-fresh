name: üîç Plugin Analysis & Documentation (Copilot Agent)
about: Run a deep analysis and documentation generation task for an OctoberCMS plugin under plugins/omsb/
title: "[Copilot Agent] Analyze & Document <plugin-name>"
labels: [documentation, analysis, plugin, octobercms, copilot-agent, backend, tech-debt]
assignees: []

## üß† Objective
Run a **comprehensive analysis** of the `<plugin-name>` plugin (path: `plugins/omsb/<plugin-name>`) and produce complete developer documentation inside its `/docs/` directory.  
The goal is to clarify the plugin‚Äôs purpose, features, backend integrations, API endpoints, dependencies, and improvement opportunities.

## üßæ High-Level Tasks
- [ ] Identify plugin purpose and summarize its role within the ERP ecosystem.
- [ ] Map all models, controllers, and backend components.
- [ ] Document form/list behaviors and YAML configurations.
- [ ] Identify API endpoints, events fired/listened, middleware, and routes.
- [ ] Document integration points with other `omsb` plugins.
- [ ] Document console commands, schedulers, and CLI utilities.
- [ ] Document facades, traits, behaviors, and service providers.
- [ ] Perform security & performance review.
- [ ] Suggest feature improvements and integration opportunities.
- [ ] Generate markdown documentation for each deliverable above.
- [ ] Produce a PR named `[docs] Add <plugin-name> analysis & docs`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Analysis Guide

### 1. Purpose & Capability
- Describe what the plugin does and its technical boundaries.
- Explain how it supports business workflows within the OMS ERP.

### 2. Models & Database
- For each model:
  - Table name, fields, casts, relationships, validation, scopes.
  - Example queries and recommended indexes.
  - Related migrations and factories.

### 3. Controllers & Backend Behavior
- List all controllers and their behaviors (FormController, ListController, etc.).
- Document custom controller behaviors and YAML configs.
- Include usage examples for backend forms or lists.

### 4. Components, Widgets & Partials
- Document custom backend components, list columns, form widgets.
- Provide configuration examples and screenshots if possible.

### 5. API Endpoints & Events
- Document all HTTP routes (method, path, controller, params, auth).
- List events (dispatched/listened) and payload structure.
- Provide request/response examples for each endpoint.

### 6. Services, Providers, & Facades
- List all service providers, facades, singletons, and DI bindings.
- Explain initialization and usage context.

### 7. Console Commands & Schedulers
- List all Artisan commands and their syntax.
- Document any scheduled tasks and their cron expressions.

### 8. Tests
- Detect existing test coverage and identify gaps.
- Propose test cases for key logic (models, controllers, endpoints).
- Include example PHPUnit/Pest skeletons.

### 9. Security & Performance Review
- Check for:
  - Mass assignment or unvalidated input
  - File upload sanitization
  - Unbounded queries or missing pagination
  - Potential authorization holes
- Suggest caching, eager loading, or indexing improvements.

### 10. Future Improvements
Provide prioritized recommendations:
- Custom Form Fields / List Columns
- Controller or Model Behaviors
- Service Providers / Facades
- Custom Console Commands
- Dashboard or Report Widgets
- API Resources / Middleware
- Integration with OctoberCMS v4 Dashboard widgets

Each suggestion should include:
- **Purpose**
- **Implementation outline**
- **Effort (S/M/L)**
- **Impact (Low/Med/High)**

---

## üìú Output Standards
- Markdown must be **clear, structured, and include YAML and PHP examples**.
- Each file must contain code paths or evidence lines.
- Integration diagrams (SVG/PNG) to be stored under `/docs/assets/`.
- `07_code_review.md` must contain at least 10 actionable findings.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] /docs/ directory created with all deliverables.
- 	[ ] Integration and dependency diagrams included.
- 	[ ] 07_code_review.md includes ‚â•10 findings.
- 	[ ] API endpoints documented with request/response samples.
- 	[ ] 3 suggested improvements with implementation outlines.
- 	[ ] Test plan provided with at least 3 sample test skeletons.

## üß≠ Notes for the Copilot Agent

- [ ] Be explicit and evidence-based.
- [ ] Where uncertain, mark findings as NOTE: inferred with file and line reference.
- [ ] When suggesting refactors or enhancements, include minimal code snippets or YAML examples to demonstrate the approach.
